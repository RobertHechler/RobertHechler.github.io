	abstract = {As early-career professionals (ECPs) navigate their education and professional development in the aquatic sciences, many seek to build a network to help guide their entrance into the field. As influential organizations, scientific societies play a vital role through hosted conferences, where ECPs can meet and share ideas with others, and find mentors to facilitate their colleagues’ journey within the profession. However, not all ECPs are the same, and those from marginalized backgrounds face unique challenges. Here, we provide a perspective on ways scientific societies can ensure all members are provided with equitable opportunity to discover, access, and build career-defining networks at conference events, including the critical role of mentors in navigating obstacles to success. Our recommendations originate from an early-career networking workshop in 2022 at a Canadian fisheries and aquatic sciences conference. The day-long hybrid event comprised interactive activities and discussions on how societies and their conferences can foster and promote inclusive networking for all, including suggestions on maximizing inclusivity for online attendees. This perspective serves as a call to action for scientific societies and senior-career professionals to meaningfully engage with ECPs and marginalized members to promote transformative science.},

	abstract = {Although the use and development of molecular biomonitoring tools based on environmental nucleic acids (eDNA and eRNA; collectively known as eNAs) have gained broad interest for the quantification of biodiversity in natural ecosystems, studies investigating the impact of site-specific physicochemical parameters on eNA-based detection methods (particularly eRNA) remain scarce. Here, we used a controlled laboratory microcosm experiment to comparatively assess the environmental degradation of eDNA and eRNA across an acid–base gradient following complete removal of the progenitor organism (Daphnia pulex). Using water samples collected over a 30-day period, eDNA and eRNA copy numbers were quantified using a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of D. pulex. We found that eRNA decayed more rapidly than eDNA at all pH conditions tested, with detectability—predicted by an exponential decay model—for up to 57 h (eRNA; neutral pH) and 143 days (eDNA; acidic pH) post organismal removal. Decay rates for eDNA were significantly higher in neutral and alkaline conditions than in acidic conditions, while decay rates for eRNA did not differ significantly among pH levels. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for a predictive framework assessing the persistence and degradation dynamics of eRNA and eDNA across a range of ecologically relevant pH conditions, establish the potential for eRNA to be used in spatially and temporally sensitive biomonitoring studies (as it is detectable across a range of pH levels), and may be used to inform future sampling strategies in aquatic habitats.},
