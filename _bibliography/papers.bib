	abstract = {As early-career professionals (ECPs) navigate their education and professional development in the aquatic sciences, many seek to build a network to help guide their entrance into the field. As influential organizations, scientific societies play a vital role through hosted conferences, where ECPs can meet and share ideas with others, and find mentors to facilitate their colleaguesâ€™ journey within the profession. However, not all ECPs are the same, and those from marginalized backgrounds face unique challenges. Here, we provide a perspective on ways scientific societies can ensure all members are provided with equitable opportunity to discover, access, and build career-defining networks at conference events, including the critical role of mentors in navigating obstacles to success. Our recommendations originate from an early-career networking workshop in 2022 at a Canadian fisheries and aquatic sciences conference. The day-long hybrid event comprised interactive activities and discussions on how societies and their conferences can foster and promote inclusive networking for all, including suggestions on maximizing inclusivity for online attendees. This perspective serves as a call to action for scientific societies and senior-career professionals to meaningfully engage with ECPs and marginalized members to promote transformative science.},
