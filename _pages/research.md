**Research interests:** Quantitative Ecology, Molecular Ecology, Aquatic Ecology, Global Change Biology, Conservation Biology.

I'm a PhD candidate and Vanier Scholar working with [Dr. Martin Krkosek](https://krkosek.eeb.utoronto.ca/) at U Toronto. I'm broadly interested in understanding how biodiversity responds to changing environments and enjoy using molecular and quantitative methods to do so. My current projects are investigating drivers of nonlinear population dynamics and assessing wild salmon health in relation to industrial activities (in collaboration with the [Musgamagw Dzawadaâ€™enuxw Fisheries Group](https://mdfgfisheries.ca/) and [Salmon Coast](https://salmoncoast.org/)). Prior to this, I completed an MSc with [Dr. Melania Cristescu](https://www.mcgill.ca/cristescu-lab/) at McGill University where I developed environmental RNA based transcriptomics to monitor the heat stress responses of aquatic organisms.
